# What is react 

## A JavaScript library for building user interfaces &#127942;

- **Components:** React is built around the concept of components, which are self-contained UI elements that can be reused throughout your application.

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which is more efficient than directly manipulating the actual DOM.

- **State management:** React provides a way to manage state within components, which makes it easier to build complex UIs.

- **JSX:** React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.
